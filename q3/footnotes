what is the average running time?
>0.00000000 s

Increase N and compile the code, what is the average running time now?
>0.00000000 s

why is the execution time like that in the previous question when the flag -O2 is used? 
Answer this question using the information you find in the assembly code.
> Looking at the assembly code, it is obvious that the compiler did not generate anything for the array operations inside the for 
loops. It is highly probable that because of using the -02 flag, the compiler tries to optimize the code and as the arrays aren't 
used anywhere else in the loop, the compiler discards them and they are not compiled into assembly code. Hence, using the -02 flag
only compiles the mysecond function, resulting in a very low execution time.


What is the average execution time without the -O2 compilation flag?
> for N = 5000:
 RUN 1: 0.00007200 s 
 RUN 2: 0.00008106 s
 RUN 3: 0.00007296 s
 RUN 4: 0.00007319 s
 RUN 5: 0.00006604 s

 AVG_5: 0.00007305 s

for N = 15000:
 RUN 1: 0.00022292 s 
 RUN 2: 0.00022888 s
 RUN 3: 0.00022697 s
 RUN 4: 0.00022793 s
 RUN 5: 0.00022197 s

 AVG_5: 0.000225734 s


  It is because not using the -02 flag doesn't optimize the code, hence it doesn't eliminate the arrays inside the loops.
Increasing N increases the number of times the loops run, hence increasing the computation time.
